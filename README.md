# # Insurance-Management-Platform-

## Spring Boot CRUD Project:
This is a simple Spring Boot Insurance-Policy-Management application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database using Spring Data JPA. 
The application exposes a RESTful API that allows users to perform these operations on different entities.

## Tech
- [Spring Boot] - Powering our REST Apis with good, old Java.(Star of the show!! âœ¨âœ¨)
- [Postman] - Postman to check Api is working coreectly or not.

## Installation
Start with setting up your own MySQL server and acquire url, username and password.
After doing that fork this repo and continue with IDE of your choice. 

### Backend (Spring Boot)
Locate the `application.properties` file and do the following changes:
```
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<YOUR_CONNECTION_URL>?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=<YOUR_USERNAME>
spring.datasource.password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
```
Run the project in your IDE and "Voila! Your REST APIs are up and running". (I hope!ðŸ˜‰ ). Now acquire the endpoint_url and proceed with the setup.

Check API through the postman:
1. Go to the Postman.
2. Write the endpoints with the your local localhost and choose whatever method you want to see.
3. Now run it!
